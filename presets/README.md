# Presets

Various presets for [backfill-yomitan](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1184164376) that I used to convert my existing cards. These are useful for backfilling information that some programs don't support.

- **backfill-frequencies.json** - Adds `Frequency` and `Frequency Sorting`.
- **backfill-pitch.json** - Adds `Pitch`, `Pitch Position`, and `Pitch Categories`.
- **backfill-jidoujisho-to-yomitan.json** - Replaces `Definition Glossary` as Jidoujisho has broken formatting for some dictionaries.
